# Numerical-Solutions-for-PDE
This is an undergraduate course project, in which we implement the finite difference method to solve Poisson's equation, the multigrid method, and solve the initial value problem to simulate three-body motion.

## Introduction
In this repository, we include three course projects on numerical solutions to differential equation. In order to increase the readability of the project, we also attach the experimental report of the corresponding project.
1.  In project 1, we use finite difference to realize various boundary problems of partial differential equations in two dimensions.
2.  The multi-grid method in one-dimensional case is implemented in Project 2.
3.  In the last project, we use Adams-Bashforth, Runge-Kutta and other numerical methods, combined with the template-like technology, to simulate the three-body motion system.

## Usage
For each project we can just use Makefile in the terminal to produce corresponding executable file.
```sh
make
```
